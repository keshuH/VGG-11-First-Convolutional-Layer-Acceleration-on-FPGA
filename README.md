# VGG-11-First-Convolutional-Layer-Acceleration-on-FPGA

## About
The VGG architecture, specifically VGG-11, is a deep convolutional neural network (DNN) developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford. It has gained popularity due to its excellent performance in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). The architecture consists of 11 layers, with 8 convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers for classification.

While VGG-11 is known for its simplicity and accuracy, it is also computationally expensive and memory-intensive, posing a challenge for deployment on hardware platforms like FPGAs. In this project, we aim to accelerate the first convolutional layer of VGG-11 by using FPGA hardware, with optimizations such as convolution tiling and fixed-point precision to reduce resource usage and improve performance.

## Inspiration Behind the Project
The need for fast, low-latency computation in image classification tasks has increased as the demand for real-time AI applications grows. VGG-11, though simple, offers high accuracy but suffers from high computational costs. By accelerating the first convolutional layer with FPGA, we can take advantage of the parallel processing power of FPGAs to significantly speed up the convolution operations and reduce the overall computational burden. This would make it possible to run complex models like VGG-11 on resource-constrained devices with low power consumption.

## What This Project Does
This project focuses on accelerating the first convolutional layer of the VGG-11 model on an FPGA. The key aspects of the project include:
- **Tiled Convolution**: Optimizing the convolution process using tiling to partition the image and filter operations for efficient computation.
- **Numeric Precision Optimization**: Exploring the impact of using fixed-point arithmetic instead of floating-point to reduce hardware resource usage and improve speed.
- **HLS-Based IP Design**: Using High-Level Synthesis (HLS) to convert high-level C/C++ code into FPGA hardware description and deploying it on the FPGA platform for real-time acceleration.

## How We Built It
1. **VGG-11 Architecture**: The original VGG-11 model with 8 convolutional layers was used as the baseline for this project. The first convolutional layer was the focus of optimization due to its computational intensity.
2. **Convolution Tiling**: Tiling is used to break down the convolution operation into smaller, more manageable blocks. This reduces memory access overhead and allows for better parallel processing on the FPGA.
3. **Numeric Precision Optimization**: The project compared floating-point precision with fixed-point arithmetic. Fixed-point representation was chosen due to its lower hardware resource requirements and better efficiency for FPGA implementation.
4. **High-Level Synthesis (HLS)**: The convolution operation was written in C++ and converted into hardware description using HLS tools like Xilinx Vitis. The code was then synthesized into FPGA logic and deployed on the FPGA board.
5. **FPGA Deployment**: The final IP block was deployed on a Xilinx FPGA, and the performance was verified by running image classification tasks using the optimized first convolutional layer.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- **Memory Bandwidth**: The VGG-11 model requires a significant amount of memory bandwidth, especially for large image inputs. Optimizing memory access patterns using tiling and other techniques was essential to address this challenge.
- **Resource Constraints**: The limited resources of the FPGA made it challenging to implement the full VGG-11 model. As such, we focused on optimizing the first convolutional layer, which provided the greatest computational bottleneck.
- **Precision Trade-off**: While fixed-point arithmetic improved hardware efficiency, it required careful tuning to ensure that the model's accuracy was not compromised by reduced precision.
